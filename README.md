# Spring Boot 3.0 Security with JWT Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of authentication and authorization using **Spring Boot 3.0** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.  
It provides a secure way to register and authenticate users, manage access based on roles, and handle token refresh for continuous access.  
The project follows modern security practices with **Java 21** and **Spring Security**.

## Features
- User registration and login with JWT-based authentication  
- Password encryption using **BCrypt**  
- Role-based authorization with Spring Security  
- Customized access denied handling  
- Logout mechanism  
- Refresh token support  

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**  
- **Spring Boot 3.0**  
- **Spring Security**  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**  
- **BCrypt** for password hashing  
- **Gradle** (build tool)  
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
